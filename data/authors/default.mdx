I’m Robert Woodhams, a First-Class Computer Science graduate from the University of Plymouth and founder of several software ventures including Standard Cyber, HouseFlow, TradeFlow, and Woodhams Software.

As a full-stack engineer, I specialise in building scalable, production-ready systems using React Native, Next.js, Node.js, and Supabase, with a focus on clean architecture, automation, and user experience. I’ve architected modular SaaS platforms, mobile apps with active user bases, and CI/CD-driven deployments through Docker and GitHub Actions.

My work bridges software engineering and entrepreneurship from designing intuitive UIs and integrating secure payment systems, to developing microservices and containerised infrastructures. I’m particularly passionate about cybersecurity and building tools that empower businesses through technology.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, refining my systems, and sharing my journey of turning ideas into fully realised digital products.
