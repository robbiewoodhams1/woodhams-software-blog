# 1.0 Prerequisites

Before you can create a nextjs project you need to install Node.js.

### 1.1 Double Check

To check if you have node already installed run these commands in your terminal first:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

- If you get versions for example something like v18.17.0 and 10.2.0, you’re good to go part 2.0.

- If you get errors continue below to 1.2.

### 1.2 No Node

If do not have node, install Node.js from https://nodejs.org

# 2.0 Create a NextJS project

First go to the folder you want your app to be located. Do not worry about creating a new folder for it, it will automatically create one. For example I want it to be saved here C:Projects. To get there in terminal use the cd .. to go back a directory and then cd Projects to enter.

```
C:\Users\Robbie> cd ..
C:\Users> cd ..
C:\>cd projects
C:\Projects>
```

### 2.1 Initialise the App

With the terminal in the right directory run this command:

```
C:\Projects> npx create-next-app@latest
```

### 2.2 Questions Asked

NextJS will ask some questions about your app, they are explained briefly here below:

- √ What is your project named? ... ExampleProjectName

This will be the name of your project and the folder that it will be in.

- √ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No / Yes

This is the language you will use. Yes for TypeScript, no for JavaScript. You will want to use TypeScript.

- √ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No / Yes

This is a linting package that keeps code consistent and prevents bugs. You will want to have it.

- √ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / Yes

This is how you style your frontend. You will want to have it.

- √ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ... No / Yes

This is asking if you want your code inside another folder called src inside the ExampleProjectName folder. This is personal preferance, I press no.

- √ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / Yes

This ensures every file inside the pages/ folder becomes a route automatically, so you don't need extra setup when changing pages. You will want this.

- √ Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? ... No / Yes

This speeds up the local development experience. If you are new it will be fine to have, if in doubt press no.

- √ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? ... No / Yes

This adds a custom import alias for your project. The default is fine for now press no.

### 2.3 Run the app in development

To run your first NextJS project follow these commands:

```
C:\Projects> cd ExampleProjectName
C:\Projects\ExampleProjectName> npm run dev
```

### 2.4 Run the app for production

To test your app for production follow these commands:

```
C:\Projects\ExampleProjectName> npm build
C:\Projects\ExampleProjectName> npm start
```
