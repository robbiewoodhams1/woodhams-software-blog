# Overview

In this tutorial we will cover how to host a webapp / website using Vercel. Vercel is a cloud platform for developers to build, deploy, and scale web applications, especially those built with frontend frameworks like Next.js. Lets get started.

# 1.0 Prerequisites

Before you can host on vercel you need to create an account, and have a NextJS project committed to GitHub. Click here to see [How to Create a Web App](https://blog.woodhamssoftware.com/blog/web-app/create-web-app). It doesnt need to be NextJS but following the previous blog posts thats what we will cover.

# 2.0 Setup Steps

The process is very quick and easy for setting up NextJS on Vercel as shown below:

- Create a Team (if you do not have one)
- In Overview press 'Add new' -> 'Project'
- Import the Git Repository you want to host.
- If you have any environment variables add them here, however if it is a basic website you can press deploy

# 4. Known Bugs

### 4.1 Next Build Errors

You may face build errors if you have a more complicated app. I cannot predict what you will have just go through them sequentially by running npm run build in the terminal, and fixing each bug until npm run build works.
